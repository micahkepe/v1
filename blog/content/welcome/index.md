Congratulations! You have found my "secret" blog- you must have been snooping
around. It is a hidden gem that only the most curious and adventurous visitors
will discover.

<!-- more -->

This blog is a place for me to share personal stories, thoughts, and reflections
that don't quite fit into the rest of my site.

For those curious, this blog is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a
static site generator written in Rust, because I am too lazy to write the code
myself (**The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and
Hubris" - Larry Wall**). The theme is a custom Zola theme called
[`radion`](https://github.com/micahkepe/radion)
that I made based off the
[`after-dark` theme](https://github.com/getzola/after-dark).
