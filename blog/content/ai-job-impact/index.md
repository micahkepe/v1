No doubt you've heard it before: "AI will make programmers obsolete" or "AI
will take your job." But is this narrative accurate? News stories like
Cognition AI's [Devin](https://www.cognition.ai/blog/introducing-devin),
albeit found to be [categorically a
hoax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNmgmwEtoWE&t=611s), have nonetheless
fueled fears among software professionals about the future of their careers.
However, the most current look at the state of AI in software development
suggests a more nuanced and hopeful future.

## The AI Job Impact Narrative

The narrative that AI will replace programmers is not new. This idea has
pervaded movies, books, and news stories for decades dating back to the
beginnings of the first wave of AI research in the 1950s following the
Dartmouth Conference in 1956 (the event where the term "artificial
intelligence" was first coined). In 1984, the Australian newspaper The Age
published an article entitled ["Researchers coming with some provocative
hi-tech findings"](https://books.google.com/books?id=eTRVAAAAIBAJ&pg=PA38&dq=artificial+intelligence+jobs&article_id=6556,2471720&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit047aoLSHAxV-JkQIHSGAAHUQ6AF6BAgIEAI#v=onepage&q=artificial%20intelligence%20jobs&f=false), in which the author details the opinions of two Stanford University professors, Henry Levin and Russell Rumberger, who studied employment statistics and concluded that "high technology is no panacea for unemployment... high technology will reduce the skills required by workers in the next decade because **machines will do the work**. Creativity and innovation by many individual workers will suffer." The article goes on to quote another Stanford computer science professor, [Edward Feigenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Feigenbaum), a prominent artificial intelligence researcher who at the time said:

{{ note(body='
\"One of the worst pieces of advice you can give youngsters today is to
become a computer programmer. Automation of software development will
take place in this decade and the 1990s.\"

') }}

Obviously, the likes of Bill Gates, Linus Torvalds, and countless other
software professionals who have made their careers in the decades since would
beg to differ. More recently, in 2018, McKinsey & Company, a global
management consulting firm, predicted that [800 million jobs would be
lost](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/ai-automation-and-the-future-of-work-ten-things-to-solve-for)
to automation by 2030. In countless media outlets since, the narrative has
been repeated and amplified.

) }}

The proliferation of this narrative has led to widespread fear and
uncertainty among software professionals. In 2019, Forbes published an
[article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2019/07/15/is-ai-going-to-be-a-jobs-killer-new-reports-about-the-future-of-work/)
that cites a ZipRecruiter survey finding that "One in five job seekers (one
in three for those between the ages of 18 and 22) fear they will one day lose
their job to AI." Fast forward to 2023, and a representative Gallup web poll
of over 5,400 Americans found that 75% of respondents believe AI will reduce
the total number of jobs in the United States in the next 10 years.

) }}

However, we don't have to accept this narrative based solely on projections
and surveys—- the data is in and the results are more optimistic than you
might think.

## The Data is In

Annually, Stanford University's Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI)
Institute releases a report called the [AI
Index](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/report/). The AI Index is a comprehensive
report that tracks and measures the progress of AI research and development
across a variety of metrics. Here are some of the key takeaways from the 2024
report:

- **AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work.**

    alt="Cross-study comparison of AI's impact on task completion speed of
        Copilot users",
    caption="Above: Cross-study comparison of AI's impact on task completion
        speed of Copilot users",
    width=80
) }}

"AI has been shown to enable workers to complete tasks more quickly and
**produce higher quality work**. A meta-review by Microsoft, which
aggregated studies comparing the performance of workers using Microsoft
Copilot or GitHub’s Copilot LLM-based productivity-enhancing tools with those
who did not, found that Copilot users completed tasks in **26% to 73% less
time** than their counterparts without AI access" (AI Index, 2024, p. 272)

- **AI is creating new jobs.**

    alt="Private investment in AI by geographic area, 2023",
    caption="Above: Private investment in AI by geographic area, 2023",
    width=80
) }}

"The United States once again led the world in terms of total AI private
investment. In 2023, the **$67.2 billion invested** in the United States was
roughly 8.7 times greater than the amount invested in the next highest country,
China (\\\$7.8 billion), and 17.8 times the amount invested in the United Kingdom
(\\\$3.8 billion)" (AI Index, 2024, p. 247)

"Consistent with trends in private investment, the United States leads all
regions with **897 new AI companies**, followed by China with 122, and the
United Kingdom with 104." (AI Index, 2024, p. 251)

A great recent blog post from Builder.io, a company that builds AI-powered
tools for developers, also provides a [comprehensive look](https://www.builder.io/blog/ai-jobs-truth)
at the current state of AI in the software industry and also seeks to dispel
the myth that AI will replace software professionals. The post states:

{{ note(body="
By automating routine tasks and augmenting human capabilities,
AI tools are ushering in a new golden age of software engineering.

Developers who adapt and leverage these tools will find themselves
more productive, more creative, and more valuable than ever before.
The future of software engineering isn't about competing with AI —
it's about orchestrating it to build amazing things.
") }}

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics also provides a [positive
outlook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm)
for the future of software development jobs, stating, "Overall employment in
computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow much
faster than the average for all occupations from 2022 to 2032. About
**377,500 openings are projected each year**, on average, in these
occupations due to employment growth and the need to replace workers who
leave the occupations permanently."

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for employees in "custom computer
programming services" from the Current Employment Statistics survey also
shows a steady increase in employment over the past 10 years:

## Historical Precedent: The Rise of Spreadsheets

In the late 1970s, the accounting industry was on the brink of a
technological revolution. Before the advent of electronic spreadsheets, the
accounting industry relied heavily on manual calculations and paper-based
record-keeping. Accountants, clerks, and bookkeepers spent countless hours
poring over ledgers, meticulously ensuring every number added up. This
labor-intensive process was the norm for decades.

Then came VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet program, launched in 1979. At
first, many accountants were skeptical, even fearful. The idea that a piece
of software could perform calculations and automate tasks traditionally done
by hand was both revolutionary and terrifying. They worried about job
security and the potential devaluation of their skills.

In the book Leading Projects with Data, author Marcus Glowasz writes:

{{ note(body="
Nowadays, no accountant would imagine doing their work by hand, but back
then [in the late 1970s and early 1980s], many accountants were hesitant,
fearing that these tools would make their jobs obsolete. And, to some
extent, their fears were well-founded. Since 1980, around 400,000 accounting
clerks have become obsolete as spreadsheets took over their role. But
spreadsheets made accounting more effective and easier, which resulted in
600,000 new jobs in the accounting industry. (Glowasz, 2022, p. 138-139)
")}}

The introduction of spreadsheets did indeed lead to the automation of many
tasks previously done manually. However, it also created new opportunities
and job roles that didn't exist before. By no longer having to spend hours on
calculations, accountants could focus on higher-level analysis, strategy, and
decision-making, leading to the emergent and lucrative roles of financial
analysts, controllers, and CFOs. The fear of job loss was replaced by a
newfound optimism and excitement for the future.

## Opinion: Enthusiasm for the Future

Personally, one of the more exciting pieces of news surrounding AI in the
past year was the announcement of a new project from GitHub called [GitHub
Copilot Workspace](https://github.blog/2024-04-29-github-copilot-workspace/).
This project aims to allow developers to write their tasks in natural
language and have Copilot generate the code systematically for them. As the
blog post explains, the workflow for Copilot Workspace is as follows:

1. **Write a task**: Describe the task you want to accomplish in natural
   language in a GitHub issue or new GitHub repository.
2. **Workspace creates the plan**: Copilot Workspace generates a step-by-step
   plan to accomplish the task. The plan is entirely editable and can be
   tweaked to fit your needs.
3. **Execute the plan**: Copilot Workspace generates the code for each step
   in the plan. You can run the code in the workspace and edit it as needed
   until you are satisfied with the results. You can then create a pull
   request to merge the code into your project.

The implications of this project are vast in my mind. Using this tool
drastically lowers the barrier to entry for new developers-- you don't even
need to use an IDE as GitHub already has a web-based code editor. As the
article states, "With Copilot Workspace we will empower more experienced
developers to operate as systems thinkers, and materially lower the barrier
of entry for who can build software... we are accelerating to **a near future
where one billion people on GitHub will control a machine just as easily as
they ride a bicycle.**" If writing code becomes as easy as writing a natural
language description of the task, the possibilities for what can be built are
endless. In the same vein as VisiCalc and the rise of spreadsheets, imagine
the lucrative new job roles that could emerge as programming's skill focus
shifts from low-level syntax to high-level problem-solving and creativity.

As of the time of writing, Copilot Workspace is still only in limited
technical preview, but projects like this serve to heighten my optimism and
enthusiasm for the years to come in the software industry and the
augmentation of our jobs as software professionals to greater creative
freedom and productivity.
