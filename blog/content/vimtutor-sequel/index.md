The vimtutor program is the essential starting point for anyone looking to learn
the basics of using Vim. In as little as a half hour, you can learn 90% of what
you'll ever need for vim, however, there are many useful motions and commands
that are left out of the program. This article details the simple software
package I wrote to address this limitation, `vimtutor-sequel`.

## The Journey

I initially created `vimtutor-sequel` to fill in the gaps left by the original
vimtutor. After completing the original tutorial, I felt there were many
advanced features that users could benefit from, which were not covered. Thus,
`vimtutor-sequel` was born.
